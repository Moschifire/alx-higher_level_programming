=============================
How to Use 7-base_geometry.py
=============================

This modules defines a base geometry class BaseGeometry.

Instantiation
=============

``BaseGeometry`` includes no attributes, and accordingly is initialized  with no arguments.

In fact, any arguments supplied to an instantiation of ``BaseGeometry`` results in a TypeError.

Methods
=======

``BaseGeometry`` features two methods - ``area(self)`` and 
``integer_validator(self, name, value)``. ``area(...)`` is not yet implemented.

The second method, ``integer_validator(...)``, validates the integer value of a paramter. The first parameter, ``name``, is the name of the argument to check. The second argument, ``value``, is the argument to check.

If ``value`` is a valid integer, the function does nothing.

But, if ``value`` is not an integer, a ``TypeError`` is raised.

And if ``value`` is an integer, but less than or equal to zero, a ValueError is raised.

Both ``name`` and ``value`` must be provided. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

The method assumes the paramter ``name`` will be a string, but ``name`` of any type will be printed.
