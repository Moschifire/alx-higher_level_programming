================================
How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage
=====

Text is printed with two new lines after each of the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:``.

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

Similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of each printed line.

New lines are only printed for the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:`` - text not ending with one of these characters is not ended with a new line

New lines within a string are printed as normal.

Invalid Text
============

The paramter ``text`` must be a string. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.
