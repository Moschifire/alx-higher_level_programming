============================
How to Use 100-matrix_mul.py
============================

This module defines a matrix multiplication function ``matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)``.

Usage
=====
``matrix_mul(...)`` returns a new matrix representing the multiplication of ``m_a`` by ``m_b``.

The function also works with floating-point numbers.

Integers and floats can be combined.

A minimum of two arguments must be provided. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.

ValueErrors
===========

If two matrices cannot be multiplied (ie. the row count of ``m_a`` is not equal to the column count in ``m_b``), a ValueError is raised.

The parameters ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` cannot be empty. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised.

Invalid Matrices
================

The parameters ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` must be lists. If either parameter is not a list, a TypeError is raised.

Not just any list - they *must* be lists of lists!

And not just any list of lists - they *must* be lists of lists containing integers or floats!

Finally, the length of all rows in matrices ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` should be equivalent. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.
