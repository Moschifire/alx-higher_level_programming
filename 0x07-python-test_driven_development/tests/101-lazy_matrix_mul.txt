How to Use 101-lazy_matrix_mul.py
=================================

This module defines a matrix multiplication function
``lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)``.

Usage
=====

``lazy_matrix_mul(...)`` returns a new matrix representing the multiplication of ``m_a`` by ``m_b``.

The function also works with floating-point numbers.

A minimum of two arguments must be provided.

ValueErrors
===========

If two matrices cannot be multiplied (ie. the row count of ``m_a`` is not equal to the column count in ``m_b``), a ValueError is raised.

The parameters ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` cannot be empty. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised.

Invalid Matrices
================

The parameters ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` must be lists. If either parameter is not a list, a ValueError is raised.

If either parameter is ``None``, a TypeError is raised.

Not just any list - they *must* be lists of lists! Otherwise, behavior is undefined.

And not just any list of lists - they *must* be lists of lists containing integers or floats! Otherwise, a ValueError or TypeError is raised.

Finally, the length of all rows in matrices ``m_a`` and ``m_b`` should be equivalent. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised.
